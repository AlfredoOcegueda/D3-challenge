          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Poverty</h1>

          <p>Between Poverty and Obesity, there exists a correlation that indicates that states with higher poverty percentages tend to have a higher obese percentage.
            Similarly, between Poverty and Smokes, the tendency indicates that the higher the poverty the higher the smokes percentage.
            Finally, between Poverty and Lacks Healthcare, there is a correlation indicating that people in poverty tend to lack healthcare.
          </p>

          <h3>Age</h3>
          <p>We can appreciate that the higher percentages of obesity appear in the age range between 36 and 40 years old. There exist a correlation that indicates that
             the higher the median age of the state, the higher the smokes percentage. Also, we can conclude that the older the people get, they tend to acquire 
             healthcare services. 
          </p>

          <h3>Household Income</h3>
          <p>There exists a correlation between Household Income and Obesity indicating that the lower the household income, the people tend to be more obese. Something 
            similar happens with Household Income a Smokes, as the percentage of smokes reduces as the household income increases. Finally, between Household Income and 
            Lacks Healthcare percentage, we can conclude that wealthier people tend to have healthcare services.
